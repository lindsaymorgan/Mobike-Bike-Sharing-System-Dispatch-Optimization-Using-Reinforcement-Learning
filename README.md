# Mobike Bike Sharing System Dispatch Optimzation Using Reinforcement Learning

• Propose indicators to measure the service reliability of shared bicycle systems.

• Propose region division method based on community structure of OD network to weaken the mutual influence between regions. Use reinforcement learning method to solve dispatching problem across the regions to improve service reliability.
